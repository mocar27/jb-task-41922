# Additional materials 
During my Computer Science studies at Univeristy of Warsaw I've had an opportunity to get a hands-on
example of experience with reverse engineering. We've had the opportunity to reverse-engineer a small
game developed specially for purpose of this assignment. There were a few tasks in that assignment,
each with different level of diffuculty. Given materials are mostly in binary format, 
but my solution contains also python script that I've coded for the purpose of solving the assignment,
as well as the explanation as how I managed to conquer every of the sub-tasks.

I'm including the assignment contents that we were provided with (mosty game assets and binaries), 
as well as, my solution to this task. My final grade for this assignment was 10 out of 10 possible.
